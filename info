Design ideas for ShooterGame
-----------------------------

Vertical shooter (see space invaders etc.)

Uses primarily untextured (or heavily pixelated textures) fairly primitive shapes for ships.
Uses simple background for now (simply star field texture with some added stuff maybe)


Pilot leveling scheme?
Could be used to create progression, unlock new hulls, new weapon types, etc.

Ships:
Based off a hull shape design
Contain attachment points for various piece of hardware
May be customized fairly heavily (maybe)
Require reseources to unlock things
Have finite resources on board (to limit certain configurations etc.)

Attachments (tentative)
Weapons
Shields
Armor
Thrusters (?)
Turrets*
Enhancement modules

Weapons:
Laser
Plasma
Missile
Other (?)

Shields:
High capacity
Fast Recharge
Enhanced Resistance* (as a varient of the others)
