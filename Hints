Controlling objects

Trevor's Thoughts

CInputManager
	IController (KeyboardController, MouseController, XBOX360Controller, etc.)
	IControllable (CPawn, CPlayer)
---	
	Players have: controllers, view ports, camera, menus/selection, game state (dead, paused)
	
	IController -> Player (focus) -> Pawn / Menu
	
Goals:

Provide an interface which allows hot swappable players to be controlled by any number of different controller interfaces.
These players pass their commands to whatever objects they may control.

Game States:

Paused - player has pause menu focused
Running - player has a pawn to control
Game Menu - Main menu system for the game

Players also have individual states. Ex: When gamestate -> paused, all playerstates -> paused.

* Console state.... Need to figure out how that will be structured.
