Notes:

1: vector cross products are important.
for strafing: cross product of forward and up vectors (z and y vectors respectively)

x and z coordinates are on a y plane...

given a speed in 3 dimensions, dot product can mask movement in directions:
vec(x,y,z) .* vec(0,1,0) produces only movement on the y axis
